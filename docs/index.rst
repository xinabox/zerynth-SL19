XinaBox SL19
*************

The SL19 xChip is equipped to measure temperature as a function of infrared light/radiation (IR) radiating from objects in its field of view. SL19 is based on the MLX90614 in which a IR sensitive thermopile detector chip and signal conditioning ASIC are integrated.

The MLX90614 is factory calibrated in wide temperature ranges: -40-125˚C for the ambient temperature and -70-380˚C for the object temperature. The measured value is the average temperature of all objects in the Field Of View of the sensor. The MLX90614 offers a standard accuracy of ±0.5˚C around room temperatures.
